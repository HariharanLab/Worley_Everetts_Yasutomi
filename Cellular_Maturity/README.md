# Developmental Progression / Cellular Maturity 
* What are the gene expression changes that occur during normal development?
* How are these genes expressed in regenerating tissues?

To address this question we generated a gene signature based on differential gene expression during normal development and then used this gene signature to investigate the cellular maturity of individual cells during regeneration.
